# Highlighter

This component is used to highlight search term in word string, used in Autocomplete's [renderOption](./autocomplete/render-option).
This is simplest possible implementation of the component. It is highly recommended to use more sophisticated solution such as [react-highlight-words](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-highlight-words).

<HighlighterPlayground />

## Limited customization

To customize the highlight effect, overwrite the `hightlighter` class.

```css tailwind copy
.hightlighter {
  @apply font-medium bg-amber-500 rounded-sm p-0.5;
}
```

## Component API
