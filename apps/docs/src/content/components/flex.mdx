# Flex

The `Flex` component is a utility component designed to simplify working with flexbox layouts in your application. It provides an intuitive API to manage flex direction, alignment, justification, wrapping, and spacing using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

import { FlexExample, properties, FlexPlayground } from '@/examples/flex'
import { Container } from '@/components/container'
import PropsTable from '@/components/props-table'
